# tinkta
Tinkta is a basic image editor for Linux and Windows.

Is based on the taiko2k's tutorial (https://github.com/Taiko2k/GTK4PythonTutorial). Tinkta uses Cairo for drawing and is an basic form creator (lines, points, forms, etc.).

With Tinkta, you can create different forms, specifying to the program the X and Y position, size, color and, even including text.
